    <h1>Introduction to Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular tools for source code management.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of Git</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching:</strong> Git allows easy creation of branches, which helps in working on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Git is designed to be fast, handling large projects efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Git is free and open-source, with a large community of contributors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
    <p>Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git init</code> - Initializes a new Git repository</li>
        <li><code>git clone &lt;url&gt;</code> - Clones a repository from a remote URL</li>
        <li><code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> - Stages changes for the next commit</li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "message"</code> - Commits the staged changes with a message</li>
        <li><code>git push</code> - Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository</li>
        <li><code>git pull</code> - Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working with Git Branches</h2>
<p>Branches are a fundamental part of Git's power. They allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. Hereâ€™s how to create and switch branches:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> - Creates a new branch with the specified name</li>
    <li><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> - Switches to the specified branch</li>
    <li><code>git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> - Merges the specified branch into the current branch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Git and Collaboration</h2>
<p>Git excels at enabling collaboration. Here are some tips for working effectively in teams:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Pull Requests:</strong> Pull requests are a way to discuss and review changes before merging them.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Commits:</strong> Commit your work frequently to keep track of progress and changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Commit Messages:</strong> Write meaningful commit messages to explain what changes were made and why.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h2>
<p>Merge conflicts occur when changes from different branches conflict with each other. Here's how to resolve them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> - Attempt to merge the specified branch into the current branch.</li>
    <li>If a conflict occurs, Git will mark the conflicted sections in the affected files.</li>
    <li>Open the conflicted files and manually resolve the conflicts by editing the marked sections.</li>
    <li>After resolving the conflicts, stage the resolved files using <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>Finally, complete the merge by committing the changes with <code>git commit</code>.</li>
</ul>


    
    <p>Git is an essential tool for modern software development, providing powerful features to manage and collaborate on code effectively.</p>
