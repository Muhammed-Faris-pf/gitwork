    <h1>Introduction to Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular tools for source code management.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features of Git</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching:</strong> Git allows easy creation of branches, which helps in working on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Git is designed to be fast, handling large projects efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Git is free and open-source, with a large community of contributors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Basic Git Commands</h2>
    <p>Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git init</code> - Initializes a new Git repository</li>
        <li><code>git clone &lt;url&gt;</code> - Clones a repository from a remote URL</li>
        <li><code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> - Stages changes for the next commit</li>
        <li><code>git commit -m "message"</code> - Commits the staged changes with a message</li>
        <li><code>git push</code> - Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository</li>
        <li><code>git pull</code> - Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Git is an essential tool for modern software development, providing powerful features to manage and collaborate on code effectively.</p>
